# Mr. Norris
Mr. Norris is a [docker container](https://www.docker.com "Docker Website") meant to be used in your CI setup [locally or hosted] to run some basic checks against your last commit[git].

Currently Mr. Norris will check if your last commit contains any  reStructuredText (reST) file.
If so Mr. Norris will execute a tiny test-suite.



## Features
For the moment:

- Spell-check, including special words and terms used within [Plone](https://plone.org "Plone CMS Website")
- Link-check, ignoring 127.0.0.1 and localhost

## Documentation
Full documentation for end users can be found in the "docs" folder.
